        <p class="headline">Lamborghini Car Rental in Miami</p>
        <p>
          Headquartered in Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy, Lamborghini was founded in 1963 by Ferruccio Lamborghini. His goal was to build a super sports car to compete with Ferrari. To make this happen, he employed Giotto Bizzarrini, who had designed some of Ferrari’s engines. Today, Lamborghini has a reputation as an iconic, limited edition car manufacturer that has become an object of desire for sports car collectors worldwide. It is no wonder that so many people desire a Lamborghini car rental in Miami, too—a city of class and extravagance.
          One interesting fact about Lamborghini is that many of their models are named after bulls. This is because Ferrucio Lamborghini was passionate about Spanish bullfighting. He admired the power of the bulls and recreated this power within his vehicles. Another relevant detail about Lamborghini is the collaboration of famous designers, like Bertone, Marcello Gandini, Zagato, and Mario Marazzi, who have helped contribute to its success.
          Think about how you are going to feel being behind the wheel of your Lamborghini car rental in Miami. Roll up to a party or a nightclub in one of our Lamborghinis and make an undeniably extravagant first impression.
